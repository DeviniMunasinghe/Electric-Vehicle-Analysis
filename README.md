Project description:

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive Electric Vehicle Sales Dashboard using Power BI for a car dealership company. The primary goal is to design and develop a dynamic, interactive dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to electric vehicle sales, including total vehicles, average electric range, and the breakdown of BEVs and PHEVs. This dashboard will provide real-time insights into sales performance, market trends, and adoption patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making and enhancing strategic planning for the dealership.

Key Features of the Dashboard:

Total Vehicles:

Tracks the total number of electric vehicles, encompassing both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), to assess the overall market size and growth.
Average Electric Range:

Monitors the average electric range of the vehicles, providing insights into technological advancements and efficiency improvements in the electric vehicle market.
Total BEV Vehicles and Percentage of Total EVs:

Displays the total number of BEVs and calculates the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the dominance and adoption of fully electric models.
Total PHEV Vehicles and Percentage of Total EVs:

Shows the total number of PHEVs and calculates the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, highlighting the market share and adoption of plug-in hybrid models.

Visualization Charts:

Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards): Line/Area Chart illustrating the distribution and growth pattern of electric vehicles over the years.
Total Vehicles by State: Map Chart showcasing the geographical distribution of electric vehicles, identifying regions with higher adoption rates.
Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make: Bar Chart highlighting the top 10 electric vehicle manufacturers based on the total number of vehicles.
Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility: Pie/Donut Chart illustrating the proportion of electric vehicles eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.
Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model: Tree Map highlighting the top 10 electric vehicle models based on the total number of vehicles, providing insights into consumer preferences and popular models.



Steps Followed

Step 1: Load Data into Power BI Desktop

The dataset, a CSV file, was loaded into Power BI Desktop.


Step 2: Open Power Query Editor

Opened the Power Query Editor.
In the View tab under the Data Preview section, checked the options for "Column Distribution," "Column Quality," and "Column Profile."


Step 3: Enable Column Profiling for the Entire Dataset

By default, profiling is enabled for only the first 1000 rows.
Changed the setting to "Column profiling based on entire dataset" to ensure comprehensive data analysis.


Step 4: Identify and Handle Errors and Empty Values

Handled the empty columns in the dataset to ensure data integrity.


Step 5: Handle Null Values for Average Electric Range

Excluded null values while calculating the average electric range as they were minimal.


Step 6: Apply a Theme in Report View

In the Report view, selected a theme from the View tab to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design.


Step 7: Add New Visualizations

Added new visualizations using various chart types in the Visualizations pane to represent different sales metrics.


Step 8: Create Card Visuals for Key Metrics

Added card visuals to represent key metrics such as total vehicles, average electric range, and the number of BEVs and PHEVs.


Step 9: Add Charts for Detailed Analysis

Used various visuals such as line charts, map charts, bar charts, pie charts, and tree maps to represent different parameters including the distribution of vehicles by model year, state, make, and CAFV eligibility.


Step 10: Add Text Boxes for Project Title and Description
